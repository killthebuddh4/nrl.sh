The Uniswap subgraph indexes data from the Uniswap contracts over time. It organizes data about pairs, tokens, Uniswap as a whole, and more. The subgraph updates any time a transaction is made on Uniswap. The subgraph runs on The Graph protocol's hosted service and can be openly queried.Resources‚ÄãSubgraph Explorer - sandbox for querying data and endpoints for developers.Uniswap V2 Subgraph - source code for deployed subgraph.Usage‚ÄãThe subgraph provides a snapshot of the current state of Uniswap and also tracks historical data. It is currently used to power uniswap.info. It is not intended to be used as a data source for structuring transactions (contracts should be referenced directly for the most reliable live data).Making Queries‚ÄãTo learn more about querying a subgraph refer to The Graph's documentation.Versions‚ÄãThe Uniswap V2 Subgraph only tracks data on Uniswap V2.
