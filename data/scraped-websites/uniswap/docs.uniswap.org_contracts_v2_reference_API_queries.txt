This page will provide examples for common queries.To try these queries and run your own visit the subgraph sandbox.Global Data​To query global data you can pass in the Uniswap Factory address and select from available fields.Global Stats​All time volume in USD, total liquidity in USD, all time transaction count.{ uniswapFactory(id: "0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f"){   totalVolumeUSD   totalLiquidityUSD   txCount }}CopyGlobal Historical lookup​To get a snapshot of past state, use The Graph's block query feature and query at a previous block. See this post to get more information about fetching block numbers from timestamps. This can be used to calculate things like 24hr volume.{ uniswapFactory(id: "0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f", block: {number: 10291203}){   totalVolumeUSD   totalLiquidityUSD   txCount }}CopyPair Data​Pair Overview​Fetch a snapshot of the current state of the pair with common values. This example fetches the DAI/WETH pair.{ pair(id: "0xa478c2975ab1ea89e8196811f51a7b7ade33eb11"){     token0 {       id       symbol       name       derivedETH     }     token1 {       id       symbol       name       derivedETH     }     reserve0     reserve1     reserveUSD     trackedReserveETH     token0Price     token1Price     volumeUSD     txCount }}CopyAll pairs in Uniswap​The Graph limits entity return amounts to 1000 per query as of now. To get all pairs on Uniswap use a loop and graphql skip query to fetch multiple chunks of 1000 pairs. The query would look like this (where skip is some incrementing variable passed into your query).{ query pairs($skip: Int!) {   pairs(first: 1000, skip: $skip) {     id   } }}CopyMost liquid pairs​Order by liquidity to get the most liquid pairs in Uniswap.{ pairs(first: 1000, orderBy: reserveUSD, orderDirection: desc) {   id }}CopyRecent Swaps within a Pair​Get the last 100 swaps on a pair by fetching Swap events and passing in the pair address. You'll often want token information as well.{swaps(orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc, where: { pair: "0xa478c2975ab1ea89e8196811f51a7b7ade33eb11" }) {     pair {       token0 {         symbol       }       token1 {         symbol       }     }     amount0In     amount0Out     amount1In     amount1Out     amountUSD     to }}CopyPair Daily Aggregated​Day data is useful for building charts and historical views around entities. To get stats about a pair in daily buckets query for day entities bounded by timestamps. This query gets the first 100 days after the given unix timestamp on the DAI/WETH pair.{ pairDayDatas(first: 100, orderBy: date, orderDirection: asc,   where: {     pairAddress: "0xa478c2975ab1ea89e8196811f51a7b7ade33eb11",     date_gt: 1592505859   } ) {     date     dailyVolumeToken0     dailyVolumeToken1     dailyVolumeUSD     reserveUSD }}CopyToken Data​Token data can be fetched using the token contract address as an ID. Token data is aggregated across all pairs the token is included in. Any token that is included in some pair in Uniswap can be queried.Token Overview​Get a snapshot of the current stats on a token in Uniswap. This query fetches current stats on DAI.
The allPairs field gets the first 200 pairs DAI is included in sorted by liquidity in derived USD.{ token(id: "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f"){   name   symbol   decimals   derivedETH   tradeVolumeUSD   totalLiquidity }}CopyAll Tokens in Uniswap​Similar to fetching all pairs (see above), you can query all tokens in Uniswap. Because The Graph service limits return size to 1000 entities use graphql skip query. (Note this query will not work in the graph sandbox and more resembles the structure of a query you'd pass to some graphql middleware like Apollo).{ query tokens($skip: Int!) {   tokens(first: 1000, skip: $skip) {     id     name     symbol   } }}CopyToken Transactions​To get transactions that include a token you'll need to first fetch an array of pairs that the token is included in (this can be done with the allPairs field on the Token entity.) Once you have an array of pairs the token is included in, filter on that in the transaction lookup.This query fetches the latest 30 mints, swaps, and burns involving DAI. The allPairs array could look something like this where we include the DAI/WETH pair address and the DAI/USDC pair address.allPairs = [ "0xa478c2975ab1ea89e8196811f51a7b7ade33eb11", "0xae461ca67b15dc8dc81ce7615e0320da1a9ab8d5"]Copyquery($allPairs: [String!]) { mints(first: 30, where: { pair_in: $allPairs }, orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc) {   transaction {     id     timestamp   }   to   liquidity   amount0   amount1   amountUSD } burns(first: 30, where: { pair_in: $allPairs }, orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc) {   transaction {     id     timestamp   }   to   liquidity   amount0   amount1   amountUSD } swaps(first: 30, where: { pair_in: $allPairs }, orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc) {   transaction {     id     timestamp   }   amount0In   amount0Out   amount1In   amount1Out   amountUSD   to }}CopyToken Daily Aggregated​Like pair and global daily lookups, tokens have daily entities that can be queries as well. This query gets daily information for DAI. Note that you may want to sort in ascending order to receive your days from oldest to most recent in the return array.{ tokenDayDatas(orderBy: date, orderDirection: asc,  where: {    token: "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f"  } ) {    id    date    priceUSD    totalLiquidityToken    totalLiquidityUSD    totalLiquidityETH    dailyVolumeETH    dailyVolumeToken    dailyVolumeUSD }}CopyETH Price​You can use the Bundle entity to query current USD price of ETH in Uniswap based on a weighted average of stablecoins.{ bundle(id: "1" ) {   ethPrice }}CopyEdit this pageHelpful?PreviousEntitiesNextGovernance ReferenceGlobal DataPair DataToken DataETH PriceDevelopersFeedbackBug Bounty#dev-chatWhitepaperGithubuniswap-v3-coreuniswap-v3-sdkuniswap-v3-peripheryDeployment addressesEcosystemHomeAppAnalyticsToken ListsBrand AssetsCommunityGovernanceDiscordTwitterBlog
