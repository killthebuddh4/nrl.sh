Within each entity are sets of fields that store useful information related to the entity. Below is a list of the available entities within the Uniswap Subgraph, and descriptions for the available fields.To see an interactive sandbox of all entities see the Graph Explorer.Each entity is defined with a value type, which will always be a base AssemblyScript type, or a custom type provided by The Graph's custom TypeScript library. For more information on value types see here.Uniswap Factory‚ÄãThe Uniswap Factory entity is responsible for storing aggregate information across all Uniswap pairs. It can be used to view stats about total liquidity, volume, amount of pairs and more. There is only one UniswapFactory entity in the subgraph.Field NameValue TypeDescriptionidIDfactory addresspairCountIntamount of pairs created by the Uniswap factorytotalVolumeUSDBigDecimalall time USD volume across all pairs (USD is derived)totalVolumeETHBigDecimalall time volume in ETH across all pairs (ETH is derived)totalLiquidityUSDBigDecimaltotal liquidity across all pairs stored as a derived USD amounttotalLiquidityETHBigDecimaltotal liquidity across all pairs stored as a derived ETH amounttxCountBigIntall time amount of transactions across all pairsToken‚ÄãStores aggregated information for a specific token across all pairs that token is included in.Field NameValue TypeDescriptionidIDtoken addresssymbolStringtoken symbolnameStringtoken namedecimalsBigInttoken decimalstradeVolumeBigDecimalamount of token traded all time across all pairstradeVolumeUSDBigDecimalamount of token in USD traded all time across pairs (only for tokens with liquidity above minimum threshold)untrackedVolumeUSDBigDecimalamount of token in USD traded all time across pairs (no minimum liquidity threshold)txCountBigIntamount of transactions all time in pairs including tokentotalLiquidityBigDecimaltotal amount of token provided as liquidity across all pairsderivedETHBigDecimalETH per tokenPair‚ÄãInformation about a pair. Includes references to each token within the pair, volume information, liquidity information, and more. The pair entity mirrors the pair smart contract, and also contains aggregated information about use.Field NameValue TypeDescriptionidIDpair contract addressfactoryUniswapFactoryreference to Uniswap factory entitytoken0Tokenreference to token0 as stored in pair contracttoken1Tokenreference to token1 as stored in pair contractreserve0BigDecimalreserve of token0reserve1BigDecimalreserve of token1totalSupplyBigDecimaltotal supply of liquidity token distributed to LPsreserveETHBigDecimaltotal liquidity in pair stored as an amount of ETHreserveUSDBigDecimaltotal liquidity amount in pair stored as an amount of USDtrackedReserveETHBigDecimaltotal liquidity with only tracked amount (see tracked amounts)token0PriceBigDecimaltoken0 per token1token1PriceBigDecimaltoken1 per token0volumeToken0BigDecimalamount of token0 swapped on this pairvolumeToken1BigDecimalamount of token1 swapped on this pairvolumeUSDBigDecimaltotal amount swapped all time in this pair stored in USD (only tracked if USD liquidity is above minimum threshold)untrackedVolumeUSDBigDecimaltotal amount swapped all time in this pair stored in USD, no minimum liquidity thresholdtxCountBigIntall time amount of transactions on this paircreatedAtTimestampBigInttimestamp contract was createdcreatedAtBlockNumberBigIntEthereum block contract was createdliquidityPositions[LiquidityPosition]array of liquidity providers, used as a reference to LP entitiesUser‚ÄãA user entity is created for any address that provides liquidity to a pool on Uniswap. This entity
can be used to track open positions for users. LiquidyPosition entities can be referenced to get
specific data about each position.Field NameValue TypeDescriptionidIDuser addressliquidityPositions[LiquidityPosition]array of all liquidity positions user has openusdSwappedBigDecimaltotal USD value swappedLiquidityPositiion‚ÄãThis entity is used to store data about a user's liquidity position. This information, along with
information from the pair itself can be used to provide position sizes, token deposits, and more.Field NameValue TypeDescriptionidIDuser address and pair address concatenated with a dashuserUserreference to userpairPairreference to the pair liquidity is being provided onliquidityTokenBalanceBigDecimalamount of LP tokens minted for this positionTransaction‚ÄãTransaction entities are created for each Ethereum transaction that contains an interaction within Uniswap contracts. This subgraph tracks Mint, Burn, and Swap events on the Uniswap core contracts. Each transaction contains 3 arrays, and at least one of these arrays has a length of 1.Field NameValue TypeDescriptionidIDEthereum transaction hashblockNumberBigIntblock transaction was mined intimestampBigInttimestamp for transactionmints[Mint]array of Mint events within the transaction, 0 or greaterburns[Burn]array of Burn events within transaction, 0 or greaterswaps[Swap]array of Swap events within transaction, 0 or greaterMint‚ÄãMint entities are created for every emitted Mint event on the Uniswap core contracts. The Mint entity stores key data about the event like token amounts, who sent the transaction, who received the liquidity, and more. This entity can be used to track liquidity provisions on pairs.Field NameValue TypeDescriptionidIDTransaction hash plus index in the transaction mint arraytransactionTransactionreference to the transaction Mint was included intimestampBigInttimestamp of Mint, used to sort recent liquidity provisionspairPairreference to pairtoBytesrecipient of liquidity tokensliquidityBigDecimalamount of liquidity tokens mintedsenderBytesaddress that initiated the liquidity provisionamount0BigDecimalamount of token0 providedamount1BigDecimalamount of token1 providedlogIndexBigIntindex in the transaction event was emittedamountUSDBigDecimalderived USD value of token0 amount plus token1 amountfeeToBytesaddress of fee recipient (if fee is on)feeLiquidityBigDecimalamount of liquidity sent to fee recipient (if fee is on)Burn‚ÄãBurn entities are created for every emitted Burn event on the Uniswap core contracts. The Burn entity stores key data about the event like token amounts, who burned LP tokens, who received tokens, and more. This entity can be used to track liquidity removals on pairs.Field NameValue TypeDescriptionidIDTransaction hash plus index in the transaction burn arraytransactionTransactionreference to the transaction Burn was included intimestampBigInttimestamp of Burn, used to sort recent liquidity removalspairPairreference to pairtoBytesrecipient of tokensliquidityBigDecimalamount of liquidity tokens burnedsenderBytesaddress that initiated the liquidity removalamount0BigDecimalamount of token0 removedamount1BigDecimalamount of token1 removedlogIndexBigIntindex in the transaction event was emittedamountUSDBigDecimalderived USD value of token0 amount plus token1 amountfeeToBytesaddress of fee recipient (if fee is on)feeLiquidityBigDecimalamount of tokens sent to fee recipient (if fee is on)Swap‚ÄãSwap entities are created for each token swap within a pair. The Swap entity can be used to get things like swap size (in tokens and USD), sender, recipient and more. See the Swap overview page
for more information on amounts.Field NameValue TypeDescriptionidIDtransaction hash plus index in Transaction swap arraytransactionTransactionreference to transaction swap was included intimestampBigInttimestamp of swap, used for sorted lookupspairPairreference to pairsenderBytesaddress that initiated the swapamount0InBigDecimalamount of token0 soldamount1InBigDecimalamount of token1 soldamount0OutBigDecimalamount of token0 receivedamount1OutBigDecimalamount of token1 receivedtoBytesrecipient of output tokenslogIndexBigIntevent index within transactionamountUSDBigDecimalderived amount of tokens sold in USDBundle‚ÄãThe Bundle is used as a global store of derived ETH price in USD. Because there is
no guaranteed common base token across pairs, a global reference of USD price is useful
for deriving other USD values. The Bundle entity stores an updated weighted average of ETH<->Stablecoin pair prices. This provides a strong estimate for the USD price of ETH that can
be used in other places in the subgraph.Field NameValue TypeDescriptionidIDconstant 1ethPriceBigDecimalderived price of ETH in USD based on stablecoin pairsHistorical Entities‚ÄãThe subgraph tracks aggregated information grouped by days to provide insights to daily activity on Uniswap. While time travel queries can be used for direct comparison against values in the past, it is much more expensive to query grouped data. For this reason the subgraph tracks information grouped in daily buckets, using timestamps provided by contract events. These entities can be used to query things like total volume on a given day, price of a token on a given day, etc.For each DayData type, a new entity is created each day.UniswapDayData‚ÄãTracks data across all pairs aggregated into a daily bucket.Field NameValue TypeDescriptionidIDunix timestamp for start of day / 86400 giving a unique day indexdateIntunix timestamp for start of daydailyVolumeETHBigDecimaltotal volume across all pairs on this day, stored as a derived amount of ETHdailyVolumeUSDBigDecimaltotal volume across all pairs on this day, stored as a derived amount of USDtotalVolumeETHBigDecimalall time volume across all pairs in ETH up to and including this daytotalLiquidityETHBigDecimaltotal liquidity across all pairs in ETH up to and including this daytotalVolumeUSDBigDecimalall time volume across all pairs in USD up to and including this daytotalLiquidityUSDBigDecimaltotal liquidity across all pairs in USD up to and including this daymaxStoredIntreference used to store most liquid tokens, used for historical liquidity chartsmostLiquidTokens[TokenDayData!]tokens with most liquidity in UniswaptxCountBigIntnumber of transactions throughout this dayPair Day Data‚ÄãTracks pair data across each day.Field NameValue TypeDescriptionidIDpair contract address and day id (day start timestamp in unix / 86400) concatenated with a dashdateIntunix timestamp for start of daypairAddressBytesaddress for pair contracttoken0Tokenreference to token0token1Tokenreference to token1reserve0BigDecimalreserve of token0 (updated during each transaction on pair)reserve1BigDecimalreserve of token1 (updated during each transaction on pair)totalSupplyBigDecimaltotal supply of liquidity token distributed to LPsreserveUSDBigDecimalreserve of token0 plus token1 stored as a derived USD amountdailyVolumeToken0BigDecimaltotal amount of token0 swapped throughout daydailyVolumeToken1BigDecimaltotal amount of token1 swapped throughout daydailyVolumeUSDBigDecimaltotal volume within pair throughout daydailyTxnsBigIntamount of transactions on pair throughout dayTokenDayData‚ÄãTracks token data aggregated across all pairs that include token.Field NameValue TypeDescriptionidIDtoken address and day id (day start timestamp in unix / 86400) concatenated with a dashdateIntunix timestamp for start of daytokenTokenreference to token entitydailyVolumeTokenBigDecimalamount of token swapped across all pairs throughout daydailyVolumeETHBigDecimalamount of token swapped across all pairs throughout day stored as a derived amount of ETHdailyVolumeUSDBigDecimalamount of token swapped across all pairs throughout day stored as a derived amount of USDdailyTxnsBigIntamount of transactions with this token across all pairstotalLiquidityTokenBigDecimaltoken amount of token deposited across all pairstotalLiquidityETHBigDecimaltoken amount of token deposited across all pairs stored as amount of ETHtotalLiquidityUSDBigDecimaltoken amount of token deposited across all pairs stored as amount of USDpriceUSDBigDecimalprice of token in derived USDmaxStoredIntamount of token deposited in pair with highest token liquidity - used only as a reference for storing most liquid pairs for this tokenmostLiquidPairs[PairDayData]pairs with most liquidity for this tokenEdit this pageHelpful?PreviousAPI OverviewNextQueriesUniswap FactoryTokenPairUserLiquidityPositiionTransactionMintBurnSwapBundleHistorical EntitiesUniswapDayDataPair Day DataTokenDayDataDevelopersFeedbackBug Bounty#dev-chatWhitepaperGithubuniswap-v3-coreuniswap-v3-sdkuniswap-v3-peripheryDeployment addressesEcosystemHomeAppAnalyticsToken ListsBrand AssetsCommunityGovernanceDiscordTwitterBlog
