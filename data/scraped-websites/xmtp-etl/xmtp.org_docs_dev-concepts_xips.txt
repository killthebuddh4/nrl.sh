The XIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The XIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.We intend XIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community technical input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into XMTP.To learn more about XIPs and how to participate in the process, including authoring an XIP of your own, see XIP purpose, process, and guidelines.Questions?
