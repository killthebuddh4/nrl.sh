Message prxshant.eth using xmtp.chatFollow UX best practicesExplore example apps for implementation guidance and inspiration:https://demo.xmtp.chat/When you open the app, it creates a burner Ethereum account and connects it to the app. The app also creates and enables an XMTP identity for the account. And you‚Äôre ready to send demo messages with XMTP! The burner account is ‚Äúburned‚Äù as soon as the demo session ends.

You probably have some great questions by now! Check out these resources:FAQJoin and learn with the XMTP communityBlogRoadmapLitepaper - public draftRefine your app‚ÄãWant to provide more than plain text messages?  By default, building with XMTP SDKs supports plain text messages. If you‚Äôd like to provide other types of content in messages, you‚Äôll use content types. To learn more, see Content types, Use content types, and Some new content types.
Want to speed up conversation load time?  For users with large numbers of conversations, loading conversations in real-time can be a very expensive operation. You can use a persistent conversation cache to improve load time.
Want to provide push notifications?  See the example-notification-server-go for an example push notification server written in Golang that you can use as a reference for how you might provide a server for your app.    For Android apps, see Enable the example app to send push notifications.
Want to filter conversations?  By default, building with XMTP SDKs lists all conversations a user has regardless of which app started the conversation. This concept is called an interoperable inbox. If you want to provide filtered views of the user‚Äôs interoperable inbox, you can use conversation filters.
Want to label conversations?  When you display a user‚Äôs full interoperable inbox, the user may see multiple ongoing conversations they are having with another address. To help clarify the UX for users, use conversation labels.
