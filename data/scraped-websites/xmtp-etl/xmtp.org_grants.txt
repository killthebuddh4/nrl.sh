Below are just a few categories of projects we are particularly excited about.🎨 Custom content types​Media: Attachements, Voicenotes, ImagesThreading: Emoji reactions, Reply threadsTransactions and payments💾 Novel applications​Rabbithole QuestGitcoin messagingPay to message🎒 Portable consent backpack​FollowBlock/spam🧠 Protocol development​Multi-chain support (e.g. Solana, Bitcoin, Tezos, etc)Account abstraction👨🏼‍💻 Developer tools​Plug and play notification serverWeb3 resolver library👀 Unique features​Read receipts - opt-in, performant, interoperablePersonalizable conversation sorting and filteringnoteAll projects must propose a standard, tool, or concept that’s adopted by the ecosystem. This involves collaborating with the community to create a public good. You can leverage XIPs to discuss proposals.🔍 Grant types​We offer two types of grants: Micro grants and Kickstarter grants.Micro grants (<$5k):Smaller project scope, faster review processExamples:Opt-in, interoperable, performant read receiptsRabbithole questKickstarter grants (<$10K):Bigger project scope, fast review processExamples:Cross-chain support or account abstractionPortable and interoperable consent backpack📣 If you are unsure, message us via XMTP at grants.xmtp.eth and we'll be happy to help you figure out the grant type that's right for you.🎯 Evaluation criteria​We love and encourage diversity of ideas in grant applications. This section lists the baseline expectations we have for all applications.Example applications:Qualifies: a project that will introduce a novel feature (e.g. emoji reactions, read receipts, account abstraction, etc) and propose an XIP for a standard way to do it across different applications.Does not qualify: a project to integrate with XMTP to create a cool messaging app that doesn't create community resources (e.g. XIPs, dev tools, etc).noteBuilding with XMTP is permissionless and grants are not a pre-requisite to integrate with XMTP. While we love and encourage a variety of integrations, grants are reserved for integrations that create public goods.XMTP Grants are not for:Integrating with XMTP: Merely integrating with XMTP does not qualify for a grant. Grant projects must create public goods for the ecosystem. Check out the Request for Proposal section for ideas.Marketing budgets: Grant money should not be used towards promoting or advertising projects.Travel budgets: Grants are not meant to fund plane tickets, accommodation costs, and other travel expenses.Replacements for venture funding: Grants are not substitutions for a round of funding. They are aimed at enabling discrete projects that create a public good for the ecosystem.Free money: Please don’t abuse this system. Our program’s mission is to support people who believe in the potential of web3 messaging and want to contribute to building in the space.Stress relief: Our grants are not intended to extend your runway or alleviate financial stress. You should aim to build long-term in our ecosystem.Consider the following criteria if you’re uncertain whether your project qualifies for an XMTP grant:Building in public: Not all projects require code, but they should be built in the spirit of open-sourcing your learnings (and code if appropriate) for everyone to learn from.Action > Perfection: Show us how you or your team have the skills and potential to bring the proposal to life.Definitive use case: Articulate your idea clearly on how your project uses XMTP and adds value to the ecosystem. Please do not try to overthink or overcomplicate it.Public Good creation: Show clear connection between your proposal and the value it generates for the broader ecosystem.Collaborate: Be collaborative and open to offering support to other members of our community. Let’s grow together!❓ FAQ​Q: Any deadlines to keep in mind?Nope! We’re always on the lookout for cool ideas - so applications are accepted on a rolling basis.Q: Will I hear back if my application is rejected?Yes, you will hear back either from us irrespective or whether your application is successful or not.Q: I have not heard back on my application yet, can I get an update?Please check your XMTP inbox for the ENS (or EVM address) you shared with us in your application.Q: When will I receive a decision for my application?We will get back to you within 3-4 weeks of your submission.Q: How much money is the grant?Grants are up to $10K.Q: What is the deadline to deliver?Milestone dates are agreed upon by the project team and XMTP. They can be amended within reason.Q: How do I follow up once a milestone has been reached?You can fill in the form available at Claim Payments to notify us of your progress and unlock the next portion of your grant!✨ Resources and inspiration​XMTP concepts​XMTP development conceptsVision​XMTP roadmapDocumentation​JavaScript client SDK docsSDKs​JavaScript: https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-jsiOS: https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-iosFlutter: https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-flutterKotlin: Coming soon!Example apps​React web app: https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-quickstart-reactReact Native app: https://github.com/xmtp/example-chat-react-nativeProject showcase​Awesome-xmtp projects: https://github.com/xmtp/awesome-xmtpBuilt with XMTP💬 Contact us​🧑‍💻 Ask questions and file bugs on GitHub🕊️ Holler at us on Twitter👾 Join the community at Discord📬 DM us via XMTP at grants.xmtp.eth for anything elseEvery big idea starts smallApply here 🚀PreviousJoin in and contributeNextBuilt with XMTPOn this page✨ Mission📜 Request for proposals🔍 Grant types🎯 Evaluation criteria❓ FAQ✨ Resources and inspiration💬 Contact usQuestions?
