The Market3 demo showcased how both buyer and seller will have E2EE chats through an Intercom-type widget.Development team: @RealKevinYang , @zihuajliuLive demo: https://www.loom.com/share/21c1bf50846b4d25a2e0886a59057386Github repo:OTC Swap - 2nd place ü•à‚ÄãOTC Swap created a messaging-based bartering system for NFT P2P trading by using OpenSea Seaport and XMTP. The prospective buyers can give an OpenSea URL on an NFT/ token and then make an offer directly to the owner's address using XMTP.OTC Swap showed that it‚Äôs possible for buyers and sellers to have an experience built on verified wallet communication. This means the buyer has proof that the seller they are communicating with owns the item they are interested in. OTC Swap allows buyers and sellers to communicate with complete control over their identity and the experience.OTC Swap was able to accomplish this in eight hours by combining XMTP, OpenSea Seaport, IPFS, and EPNS.Development team: @0x_YuzuLive demo: https://otc-swap.vercel.app/Github repo:Burn My Wallet - 3rd place ü•â‚ÄãBurn My Wallet created a "kill switch" for a stolen wallet. When a user reports their wallet as stolen, Burn My Wallet creates a non-transferable token that marks the wallet hacked. This means applications will have a source of truth for the wallet status.  Messaging apps using XMTP can integrate the Burn My Wallet API, and easily check if wallets have been hacked. One user benefit is that this will automatically lock the conversation of the hacked wallet to prevent any spoofing or sharing of sensitive information.Development team: @NikitaVarabei, @erinleelikesLive demo: https://burnmywallet.com/Docs https://docs.burnmywallet.com/Github repo:Got an idea you‚Äôre working on?
