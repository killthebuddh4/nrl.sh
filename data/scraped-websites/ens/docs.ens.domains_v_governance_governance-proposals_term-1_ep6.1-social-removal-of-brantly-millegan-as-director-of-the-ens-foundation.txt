Transgenderism doesn’t exist. Abortion is murder. Contraception is a perversion. So is masturbation and porn.”On February 5th, 2022, brantly.eth, well-known as a prominent representative of the ENS protocol, defended these views in a publicly held Twitter space.Irrespective of one’s personal beliefs, we, as ENS DAO Community Stewards, must set the example for inclusivity and must divide our community.Propagating rhetoric that is viewed as hateful and discriminatory is not conduct conducive to the role as a Community Steward. This conduct will not be tolerated despite one’s contributions to the protocol.Through this Social Proposal, the DAO shall decide whether Brantly Millegan is deemed capable, or otherwise, of continuing his role as the Director of the Foundation Company, and to appoint a suitable replacement if he is deemed incapable.SpecificationThe removal of Brantly Millegan's directorship of the Foundation Company will be defined by a simple "Yes" or "No" vote with the option to abstain.Draft Snapshot VoteShould Brantly Millegan be removed from directorship of the Foundation Company?
