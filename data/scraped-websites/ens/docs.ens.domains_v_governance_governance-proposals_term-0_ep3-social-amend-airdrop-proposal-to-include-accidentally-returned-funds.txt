As of December 6, this amounted to some 6,246 tokens in 49 separate transactions.These funds are held in the same account as is used for new airdrop claims, and on May 4, 2022 when the airdrop expires, the DAO will be able to claim them back to its own account.​EP2 sends approximately 200k tokens to users who owned ENS names that were used as primary names but did not already benefit from the 2x multiplier.This proposal suggests that EP2 be amended to include returning the mistakenly sent funds as part of the same airdrop. This minimises overhead, as the DAO will not incur transaction fees or have to set a separate system up, and enables users to get their mistakenly sent funds back promptly.SpecificationAmend EP2 as follows:-This logic is implemented by [this series of BigQuery queries](https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/667178e854945abaecb6dfd3b6c0c279/1182eea3145394181affe4bb799d6b7858f9eb58), and shows that 1,969 accounts meet these criteria but did not qualify for the multiplier under the original criteria. The sum of the tokens these accounts would be entitled to comes to ~213,049 ENS tokens. +This logic is implemented by [this series of BigQuery queries](https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/667178e854945abaecb6dfd3b6c0c279/106d9bc156988cf96786c71f6448f13fb11599fc), and shows that 1,969 accounts meet these criteria but did not qualify for the multiplier under the original criteria.
