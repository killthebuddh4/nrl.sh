Transgenderism doesn’t exist. Abortion is murder. Contraception is a perversion. So is masturbation and porn.”On February 5th, 2022, brantly.eth, well-known as a prominent representative of the ENS protocol, defended these views in a publicly held Twitter space.Irrespective of one’s personal beliefs, we, as ENS DAO Community Stewards, must set the example for inclusivity and must not divide our community.Propagating rhetoric that is viewed as hateful and discriminatory is not conduct conducive to the role as a Community Steward. This conduct will not be tolerated despite one’s contributions to the protocol.SpecificationThe appointment of the incoming Director will be held by a ranked choice Snapshot vote from a list of pre-determined nominees. Additionally, there shall be an option for voters to select "None of the above" or abstain from this vote.Draft Ranked Choice Snapshot VoteWho should be elected as the new Director of the ENS Foundation?
