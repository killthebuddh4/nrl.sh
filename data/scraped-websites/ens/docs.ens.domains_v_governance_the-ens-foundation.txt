This page describes why this is useful, how the foundation is structured, and what powers the DAO has over the Foundation.Why have a legal entity?Having a legal entity that represents the DAO in the "real world" is valuable for a number of reasons:It provides limited liability to DAO participants for the actions of the DAO. Without a legal entity, participants may be individually held liable for anything the DAO as a whole does.It is capable of complying with taxation requirements - without a legal entity, DAO participants may be held liable for a proportion of the DAO's income, even if they are not able to access these funds.It is capable of entering into contracts with other "real world" entities, of holding assets (including IP rights), and so forth.For a more detailed discussion of this topic, see this excellent blog post.What is The ENS Foundation?The ENS Foundation is a Foundation Company Limited By Guarantee, incorporated in the Cayman Islands.
