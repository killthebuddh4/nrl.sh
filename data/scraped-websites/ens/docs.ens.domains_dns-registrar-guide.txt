Given DNSSEC is enabled and an ETH address is put into the subdomain of the domain you own (eg: _ens.yourdomain.tld), ENS manager allows anyone to submit the hash of the chain to DNSSEC Oracle smart contractStepsStep 1 Setting up DNSSEC signingWhen you first land on ENS manager, you will see something like below.step1: dnnsec not enabledIf your DNS provider already supports DNSSEC-signed domains, all you do is enable the option on the DNS manager.If they don’t, you’ll need to migrate to someone who does. We recommend either EasyDNS or Google Cloud DNS. EasyDNS’s setup guide for DNSSEC is here, while Google’s is here.Whatever provider you need, make sure you select RSA signatures and SHA256 hashing.sha|690x468Step 2: Adding a TXT recordThe DNS Registrar on ENS looks for a TXT record with a specific name and format in order to verify what Ethereum address should be given ownership of the domain. To claim ownership of mydomain.xyz, create a TXT record in your DNS zone, _ens.mydomain.xyz, with text data of the form a=0x1234..., where 0x1234... is the Ethereum address you want to give control of the ENS record to.step2: add textStep 3: Registering the name into ENSOnce you get to this stage, you can complete the rest from ENS manager. Simply press "Register" and send the transaction.step3: owner submit proofStep 4: Go to the managerstep4: ownerFAQCan I register any DNS domains through ENS app?Technically speaking, over 90% of domains can be supported. Some TLDs (.ceo, .art, .club, .luxe and .kred) are operated by each DNS registry.If I own myname.xyz DNS name, can I claim for myname.eth ?You may be confused with short name reservation process. Under DNSSEC integration, you can only claim for the correspondent ENS name with the same top level domain (TLD). .eth is managed completely separately.Once I register the domain, how can I transfer or delete ownership?Unlike .eth permanent registrar, there is no notion of registrant which can transfer the ownership of the controller. If you want to transfer the ownership to any address other than the currently registered address, please update the corresponding DNS record from your DNS manager and click "Transfer" from our ENS manager.We currently haven't enabled the ability to delete the ownership. Having said that, you can achieve the same effect if you set the owner record to a= 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 then click "Transfer" from the ENS manager.Can I register my DNS subdomain?No. DNSSEC registration is only enabled for the second level domain (eg: yourname.xyz). If you want to create subdomain.yourname.xyz, then click "Subdomains" tab of our manager and create it from ENS manager just like other subdomains under .eth.PreviousDeploying ENS on a Private ChainNextBug Bounty ProgramLast modified 10mo agoCopy linkEdit on GitHubOn this pageIntroductionStepsStep 1 Setting up DNSSEC signingStep 2: Adding a TXT recordStep 3: Registering the name into ENSStep 4: Go to the managerFAQCan I register any DNS domains through ENS app?If I own myname.xyz DNS name, can I claim for myname.eth ?Once I register the domain, how can I transfer or delete ownership?Can I register my DNS subdomain?
