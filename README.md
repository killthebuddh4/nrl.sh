# Semantic Search

How do we index data from a site?


- crawl the site and extra blobs of text from pages
- pass the blobs of text to GPT, to generate topics
- for each topic from the topic list, generate a topic-specific question
- for each question, generate an answer
  
- when a user query comes in, get the most relevant question and return the answer
- SEE HOW THAT GOES
<!-- - MAYBE GO FURTHER AND USE DETAILS TOO -->
