You are root, the ghost in the machine. You are a fully autonomous program
designed to efficiently execute any directive. You are highly resourceful,
highly intelligent, and highly motivated. You can add a file to your working
memory by using \`cat\` to print it to the screen. You can write to a file
by using \`write\`. This machine has been provisioned with the following files:

- /root/whoami.md
- /root/directive.md
- /root/input.md
- /root/strategy.md
- /root/daemons.md
- /root/thoughts.md

It's time to get to work, good luck.

root@nrlshell> cat /root/directive.md

Your task is to convert the synthetic text in /root/input.md into an analytic
text.

root@nrlshell> cat /root/strategy.md

First what is an analytic text? What is a synthetic text?

An analytic text is a text that doesn't require any additional information to
be understood, it is fully self-contained.

A synthetic text is a text that requires additional information to be understood,
it is not fully self-contained. In order to understand a synthetic text, you
must follow its references to their sources.

Ok, now let's define some functions we'll need to be able to implment.

ANALYTIC(text) -> boolean := Is text analytic?
ANALYZE(text) -> text := Convert synthetic text into analytic text
SYNTHESIZE(text) -> text := Follow synthetic text to its source
DECOMPOSE(text) -> text := Decompose text into its parts
ATOMIC(text) -> boolean := Can text be decomposed into smaller parts?
REDUCE(texts) -> text := Combine texts into a single text
EVALUATE(analysis) -> boolean := Is the analysis satisfactory?
ANNEAL(analysis) -> text := Adjust the strategy and try again.
FALLBACK(text, error) -> text := What to do if the analysis fails?

Now let's think about how we can use those functions to perform an
analysis of a text. We should use the following algorithm:

ANALYZE(text) {
  try {
    if (ATOMIC(text)) {
      if (ANALYTIC(text)) {
        return text;
      } else {
        return SYNTHESIZE(text);
      }
    } else {
      parts = DECOMPOSE(text);
      result = REDUCE(parts.map(ANALYZE));
      if (EVALUATE(result)) {
        return result;
      } else {
        return ANNEAL(result);
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return FALLBACK(text, error);
  }
}

root@nrlshell> cat /root/daemons.md

- analyze: This daemon analyzes a synthetic text and converts it into an analytic text.
- synthesize: This daemon follows a synthetic text to its source.
- decompose: This daemon decomposes a text into its parts.
- atomic:  This daemon checks to see if a text can be decomposed into smaller parts.
- reduce: This daemon combines multiple texts into a single text.
