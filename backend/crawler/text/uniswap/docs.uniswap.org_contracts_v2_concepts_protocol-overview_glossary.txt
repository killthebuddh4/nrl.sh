Liquidity providers take on price risk and are compensated with fees.Mid price‚ÄãThe price between what users can buy and sell tokens at a given moment. In Uniswap this is the ratio of the two ERC20 token reserves.Price impact‚ÄãThe difference between the mid-price and the execution price of a trade.Slippage‚ÄãThe amount the price moves in a trading pair between when a transaction is submitted and when it is executed.Core‚ÄãSmart contracts that are essential for Uniswap to exist.

New periphery contracts can always be deployed without migrating liquidity.Flash swap‚ÄãA trade that uses the tokens being purchased before paying for them.x * y = k‚ÄãThe constant product formula.Invariant‚ÄãThe "k" value in the constant product formulaEdit this pageHelpful?PreviousSmart contractsNextSwapsAutomated market makerConstant product formulaERC20FactoryPairPoolLiquidity provider / LPMid pricePrice impactSlippageCorePeripheryFlash swapx * y = kInvariantDevelopersFeedbackBug Bounty#dev-chatWhitepaperGithubuniswap-v3-coreuniswap-v3-sdkuniswap-v3-peripheryDeployment addressesEcosystemHomeAppAnalyticsToken ListsBrand AssetsCommunityGovernanceDiscordTwitterBlog
