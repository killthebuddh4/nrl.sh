Introducing "You've Got Mail"17 posts tagged with "Developers"View All TagsSome new content typesMarch 6, 2023 ¬∑ 7 min readEngineeringXMTP LabsLet's talk about some new content types for XMTP.What's a content type? A content type is a way to describe the type of content a message contains on XMTP. Out of the box, XMTP's SDKs support one content type: text.Here's the thing though: messaging has been more than just text since way back in 2002, when your LG VX8100 was blowing up from MMS.So we decided to propose some new content types: Attachment and RemoteAttachment. These new content types support rich media (images, videos, gifs, etc.) and will let you bring your messaging experience to the cutting edges of the early aughts.Tags:Content TypesSDKsDevelopersRead MoreSecure web3 customer service and support with XMTP and ENSFebruary 22, 2023 ¬∑ 8 min readMatt GalliganCo-founder of XMTP LabsIf you‚Äôve been in the web3/crypto community for longer than an hour, you‚Äôve probably seen a strange message that seems to accompany every Discord server.
