Roadmap
Learn about what's in store for XMTP in the months aheadBlogSearchLitepaperRoadmapRoadmapOn this pageRoadmapHere are a few details about what we've shipped recently, what we're working on, and what's in store for XMTP in the months ahead.Researching 🔬​Scoping goals, requirements, and effort via research & proofs of concepts.Group chat​Users will be able to send messages to group chats with 2+ participants.Team inboxes​Teams will be able to read and send encrypted DMs and announcements using a shared team identity. The account admin will be able to delegate access to and revoke access from individual team user accounts.Post delivery storage​Users will be able to store their messaging data off-network.Implement Signal protocol​xmtp-js SDK will achieve parity with the Signal protocol for security features like forward secrecy, post-compromise secrecy, and more.Account abstraction​Support account abstraction, enabling smart contract wallets and non-EVM addresses to be compatible with XMTP.In progress 🏗️​Projects in flight.Network decentralization milestones​XMTP Labs will specify a phased approach towards architectural and logical decentralization of the network.Private testnet - Phase 1​Implement control plane sharding and topic replication in a private test environment.Compromise recovery​Users will be able to recover their compromised XMTP identity by creating new private keys.App permissions​Users will be able to grant explicit permission for an app to use their account across sessions and will be able to revoke this permission at any time.Secure key storage alternatives​Users will be able to store XMTP private keys in secure contexts such as wallet apps.UI Kit & React Hooks SDK​Enable developers to focus on differentiating features by providing reusable messaging components via a UI kit & React Hooks SDK.React SDKPre-Preview 👀​A super early peek into what we're building. Ready for exploration, not adoption.Mobile support for Android and React Native​Developers will be able to build mobile client apps in Android and React Native.AndroidReact NativeDeveloper Preview 🧑‍💻​Opportunity to test, validate, and provide feedback. We do not recommend usage in production apps just yet.Mobile support for Flutter and Swift​Developers will be able to build mobile client apps in Flutter and Swift.FlutterSwiftPush notifications - example server​Apps will be able to leverage an example server to subscribe users for push notifications to their devices upon receiving new messages.Push example server repoGeneral Availability ✅​Ready for production use. Check out docs, tutorials, and the quickstart example.XMTP v2 (December 2022)​Conversation filtering​Developers can now group and filter conversations in a particular context using conversationId.Participant privacy​Network clients responsible for relaying and storing messages can no longer observe the addresses of participants in ongoing conversations.For more information about delivered features and fixes, see XMTP releases and updates.PreviousLitepaperOn this pageResearching 🔬Group chatTeam inboxesPost delivery storageImplement Signal protocolAccount abstractionIn progress 🏗️Network decentralization milestonesPrivate testnet - Phase 1Compromise recoveryApp permissionsSecure key storage alternativesUI Kit & React Hooks SDKPre-Preview 👀Mobile support for Android and React NativeDeveloper Preview 🧑‍💻Mobile support for Flutter and SwiftPush notifications - example serverGeneral Availability ✅XMTP v2 (December 2022)Questions?
