Developers build with XMTP client SDKs to provide messaging in their apps. The XMTP messaging API client takes care of:Authentication using an XMTP identity that you own and controlEnd-to-end encryption of messages that you own and controlProviding an interoperable inbox accessible across apps built with XMTPRelaying messages to the progressively decentralized XMTP networkA great way to start learning how to build an app with XMTP is to use one!To start messaging with XMTP:Pick an identity you want to use to message with XMTP.You can use an Ethereum address to start.If you have an ENS name or Lens handle associated with the address, you can tell people to use it to message you instead of using your full Ethereum address.Donâ€™t have an Ethereum address? Create a MetaMask wallet to get one.Pick an app.Converse (iOS): Works with Ethereum addresses, ENS names, and Lens handlesXMTP Inbox (web): Works with Ethereum addresses and ENS namesButtrfly (iOS): Works with Lens handlesLenster (web): Works with Lens handlesOrb (ios and Android): Works with Lens handlesSend a message.To send a message to an address, it must have an XMTP identity already created on the network. Share this page with someone you want to message to help them get on the network if they aren't already there.In the meantime, need someone to message with? Send a message to these addresses. Try using an ENS name to message one person (or bot) and an 0x Ethereum address to message another.   gm.xmtp.eth / 0x937C0d4a6294cdfa575de17382c7076b579DC176Get an immediate response from the XMTP message botyashluna.eth / 0xf220F05B4830095be149085041735F197ee3D5AaProduct manager at XMTP Labsprxshant.eth / 0x4b70d04124c2996De29e0caa050A49822Faec6CcBusiness development at XMTP LabsWant to see the interoperable inbox in action?Try a second app and see all your conversations in both apps, regardless of the app you used to start them. This also means you and a friend can each use your own preferred app to exchange messages.With XMTP, you own and control your messages and are always free to use the app that best suits your needs.Your friend using the Converse app to message you on the Orb appYou using the Orb app to message your friend on the Converse appReady to start building with XMTP?
